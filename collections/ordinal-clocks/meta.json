{"description":"ORDINAL CLOCKS are time-aware art pieces that change their color scheme with the time of day, and show an accurate to-the-second time display of the user's given timezone.  Each piece is an SVG with embedded Javascript to create a unique wavy stylistic appearance via a custom randomization algorithm.","discord_link":"","inscription_icon":"0bd9fcce9b49f6959c43534b5df7ff4f29de23fd97bd5d34ce2be8d57f9d12c7i0","name":"ORDINAL CLOCKS","slug":"ordinal-clocks","twitter_link":"https://twitter.com/mdvoll1","website_link":"","inscription_min":279567,"inscription_max":414553}
